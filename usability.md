#### Edit profile/edit job:
* Users do not have to fill certain parts of the form (e.g. password/upload image) in order to edit their job/profile, as it will only      update new changes
* There is a reset file button to make it possible for the user to keep their current profile image in a situation where they may have uploaded a different image but changed their mind.
* Both forms have pre-filled inputs based on the current information they have provided to lurkforwork

#### Add job:
* Automatically fills in the current date as the "start date", user has the ability to change it otherwise if needed

#### Forms:
* Error messages (underlying red text) are provided in the case that the user has not entered valid inputs which describe what they are doing wrong

#### Watch user by email:
* Popup provided which confirms that they have successfully followed a person if the email is of a valid user
* Also notifies if that user does not exist

#### Registration:
* Popup after registering which provides a unique userId (private) which essentially provides the ability to change a forgotten password

#### Add comment/add job description textbox:
* Automatic resizing of the textbox to allow the user to see their entire entry

#### Submit buttons:
* Are not clickable unless all required entries are valid

#### Profile card:
* Allows the user to copy another user's email when they visit their profile page (clicking on their email on their profile card will do so)
* Allows user to copy their own user ID that is only viewable to them on their own profile
* All users without a profile image will automatically be tied with a default profile image on their icons and profile image

#### Jobs/Posts:
* All jobs on either the feed or on the profile page of a user will have likes and comments accessible (user is able to view the people who liked a post, and are also able to view the comments as well)
* All names on the list of likes and comments will be clickable and will redirect user to their profile page
* All jobs regardless on whether it is on feed or someone's profile page will have like and comment interaction available to user if they are watching them

#### Watching:
* Instant updates on ability to like and comment on a post based on whether the user is currently watching another user
* E.g. User A does not watch user B and is currently viewing user B's profile, they will not be able to like/comment on the jobs shown on their profile page --> However if A clicks "watch" on B's profile, they will immediately see the like and comment interactions which are available to them on all of B's posts.

#### Home Icon:
* Redirects user to their feed page if clicked (hovering the icon will also show what it does) given that the user is logged in
